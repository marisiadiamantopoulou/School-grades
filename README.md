# School-grades
I developed a comprehensive Python project for the School of Athens, which involves creating a robust data model using a Student class and a supporting Grade class. The project encompasses the following key features:

Student Class: The Student class is designed to store student information and their academic records. It includes a constructor method for initializing student attributes such as name, year, grades, and attendance.

Grade Class: The Grade class is utilized to manage student grading, with an attribute minimum_passing set at 65. It includes a constructor method to set the score and a utility method, is_passing(), to determine if a student has achieved a passing score.

The Student class incorporates essential methods such as add_grade() for adding grades, get_average() to compute the average score, and mark_attendance() for tracking student attendance.

For practical illustration, I instantiated three instances of the Student class, namely Roger, Sandro, and Pieter, and demonstrated the usage of various methods. Additionally, I simulated the grading and attendance records for each student, generating meaningful outputs that showcase their performance and attendance.
